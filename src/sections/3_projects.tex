	{\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0.3em}
     \item Working on interpretable deep learning models, especially for natural language processing. Focusing on the vulnerability of perturbations in the attention mechanisms, developed new training technique to overcome the weakness, making attention mechanisms more robust and interpretable.
     \item Developed a general training technique to overcome the vulnerability to perturbations in attention mechanisms, inspired by adversarial training which is a powerful regularization technique for enhancing the robustness of deep learning models.~ [\href{http://shunk031.github.io/attention-meets-perturbation/}{\small{\websiteSymbol}}] ~ {\small{\lbrack\textbf{{IEEE Access'20}}\rbrack}}
     \item Developing an extension of the above method to semi-supervised learning, with additional use of unlabeled data to further improve robustness and interpretability of the model.~ {\small{\lbrack\textbf{{In Submission}}\rbrack}}
     \end{itemize}}
